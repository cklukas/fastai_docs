    "The fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices. It's based on research in to deep learning best practices undertaken at [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai), including \"out of the box\" support for [`vision`](/vision.html#vision), [`text`](/text.html#text), [`tabular`](/tabular.html#tabular), and [`collab`](/collab.html#collab) (collaborative filtering) models. If you're looking for the source code, head over to the [fastai repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) on GitHub. For brief examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/examples) folder; detailed examples are provided in the full documentation (see the sidebar). For example, here's how to train an MNIST model using [resnet18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (from the [vision example](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/examples/vision.ipynb)):"

    "At the base of everything are the two modules [`core`](/core.html#core) and [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core) (we're not including the `fastai.` prefix when naming modules in these docs). They define the basic functions we use in the library; [`core`](/core.html#core) only relies on general modules, whereas [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core) requires pytorch. Most type-hinting shortcuts are defined there too (at least the ones that don't depend on fastai classes defined later). Nearly all modules below import [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core).\n",
